Rewards will be decently conveyed concurring to the issue name prioritizing **security issue**. For each issue name we'll relegate focuses concurring the issue complexity (critical/high/medium/low) and the number of code lines included by each contributor except for security issue name the number of code lines will not be taken into account: The more **serious the vulnerability** identified is the more you will be **compensated**.
